<!-- Many people are working at home rather than in the workplace. Some people believe this will bring benefits to the workers and their families, but others suggest it will cause stress in the home. Discuss both sides and give your opinion

In the recent years, during and after the global pandemic, there has been a growing demand from paid workers to do their job remotely. For them, this is a necessary development to assure their work-life balance. Nevertheless, other people are raising their concern about remote work's effects on mental health. In this essay, the pros and cons of these approaches will be discussed.

First of all, working from home saves people their precious time. For many, this could mean a 2-hour round trip on the daily. Instead of spending this time on the road, they could improve their life by getting a little more sleep, or spending a little more time with their friends and family.

Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, working remotely may give a significant boost in productivity. It has been proven that it is easier to get into a state of deep focus without too many people around, which is unfortunately impossible to avoid in the office. This is especially true at modern workplaces, where the open office model is getting more and more common.

Despite all of its advantages, this style of working does have one major drawback: the lack of interaction with coworkers. While this kind of interaction may not be good when we want to concentrate, it is nonetheless essential for all human beings. Critics of teleworking often point out that people who work from home can become stressed out or depressed more easily since they do not have face-to-face communication with their peers.

In summary, while remote work certainly saves employees time and boost their productivity, it may cause harm to their mental health. One possiple solution to this might be the hybrid working model where we work some days in the office, and soem days at home. This may combine the best of both worlds and improve both our professional and personal life. !-->

<!-- There are many extinct animals’ species in the world. Some people think we should protect animals from dying out, while others believe we should spend more time on problems of human beings. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

With numerous wild species going extinct at historic rate, the question of whether we should spend more resources to save them, or still focus on our own species first has once again become a hotly debated topic. In this essay, the views of both sides will be discussed in more detail, and I will conclude with my personal opinion.

The first group of people argue that out of all important global issues, human well-being should still be prioritized. This school of thought is not hard to understand, as every specie must think of their own survival first before others. This is probably more relatable now that ever, during times of recession where housing prices keep rising while GDPs are dropping around the world. At the end of the day, it is difficult to tell people who cannot afford to put food on the table to go out there and save the pandas.

On the other hand, animal activists hold the belief that animals should be treated equal as humans, and therefore, their problems should be considered as equally if not more important than those of our own. They argue that our obsession with conquering nature and improving the economy is the very reason many wild species are now endangered or worse, already extinct.

While I understand the sentiment of the first group, I stand with the latter. As can be seen in many man-made problems such as deforestation and poaching, it seems clear that humans have continually trampled on wild animals' rights and failed to respect their territories. With that being said, I also hope for a future of more sustainable development, where humans no longer destroys the wilderness while still improving their quality of life.

In summary, while humans no doubt have their own problems that should rightly be focused on, animal lives have been directly worsened because of us. Because of this, I hold the view that we should make a greater effort to protect wildlife, especially endangered species. !-->

<!-- Some people think art such as sculpture and music cannot improve the quality of people’s lives so the government should not spend money on them but on health and defence. What is your opinion?

Throughout human history, the arts have always played an important role and they still do nowadays. Unfortunately, their importance is not always well understood, which leads to some people believing that they do not have any concrete benefits. In this essay, the positive effects of the arts on a personal level, as well as on a national level will be discussed.

First of all, the belief that the arts do not have any direct utility in our everyday life is not necessarily true. While for most people, playing music or painting does not earn them money, it greatly enriches their quality of life. Indeed, many studies have shown that participating in, or simply enjoying arts and music can improve our mental health and holistic well being. These activities can also serve as an excellent medium of connecting people whether in schools, at the workplace or anywhere else in a society.

Furthermore, the artistic richness of a country is often directly linked with their success in the tourism industry. This can be easily seen in touristic hot spots such as Rome, Kyoto, Athens. It is in fact the architecture, the paintings, the unique culture of these places that draw people around the world.  Of course, this contradicts the viewpoint that the arts are merely superficial and do not have any economic benefits; in contrast, they significantly strengthen a country's economy and thus deserve more funding than many believe.

In summary, artistic endeavors not only improve our personal pursuit of happiness, but also have the potential of bringing in more business to any nation. Therefore, it is without a doubt a wise choice to allocate more national funding to these professions. !-->
