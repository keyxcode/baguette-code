Many people are working at home rather than in the workplace. Some people believe this will bring benefits to the workers and their families, but others suggest it will cause stress in the home. Discuss both sides and give your opinion

In the recent years, especially after the global pandemic, there has been a growing demand from paid workers to do their job remotely. For them, this is a necessary development to assure their work-life balance. Nevertheless, other people are raising their concern about remote work's effects on mental health. In this essay, the pros and cons of these approaches will be discussed.

First of all, working from home saves people their precious time. For many, this could mean a 2-hour round trip on the daily. Instead of spending this time on the road, they could improve their life by getting a little more sleep, or spending a little more time with their friends and family.

Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, working remotely may give a significant boost in productivity. It has been proven that it is easier to get into a state of deep focus without too many people around, which is unfortunately impossible to avoid in office. This is especially true at modern workplaces, where the open office model is getting more and more common.

Despite all of its advantages, this style of working does have one major drawback: the lack of interaction with coworkers. While this kind of interaction may not be good when we want to concentrate, it is nonetheless essential for all human beings. Critics of teleworking often point out that people who work from home can become stressed out or depressed more easily since they do not have face-to-face communication with their peers.

In summary, while remote work certainly saves employees time and boost their productivity, it may cause harm to their mental health. One possiple solution to this might be the hybrid working model where we work some days in the office, and soem days at home. This may combine the best of both worlds and improve both our professional and personal life.
