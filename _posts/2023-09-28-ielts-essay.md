<!-- Many people are working at home rather than in the workplace. Some people believe this will bring benefits to the workers and their families, but others suggest it will cause stress in the home. Discuss both sides and give your opinion

In the recent years, during and after the global pandemic, there has been a growing demand from paid workers to do their job remotely. For them, this is a necessary development to assure their work-life balance. Nevertheless, other people are raising their concern about remote work's effects on mental health. In this essay, the pros and cons of these approaches will be discussed.

First of all, working from home saves people their precious time. For many, this could mean a 2-hour round trip on the daily. Instead of spending this time on the road, they could improve their life by getting a little more sleep, or spending a little more time with their friends and family.

Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, working remotely may give a significant boost in productivity. It has been proven that it is easier to get into a state of deep focus without too many people around, which is unfortunately impossible to avoid in the office. This is especially true at modern workplaces, where the open office model is getting more and more common.

Despite all of its advantages, this style of working does have one major drawback: the lack of interaction with coworkers. While this kind of interaction may not be good when we want to concentrate, it is nonetheless essential for all human beings. Critics of teleworking often point out that people who work from home can become stressed out or depressed more easily since they do not have face-to-face communication with their peers.

In summary, while remote work certainly saves employees time and boost their productivity, it may cause harm to their mental health. One possiple solution to this might be the hybrid working model where we work some days in the office, and soem days at home. This may combine the best of both worlds and improve both our professional and personal life. !-->

<!-- There are many extinct animals’ species in the world. Some people think we should protect animals from dying out, while others believe we should spend more time on problems of human beings. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

With numerous wild species going extinct at historic rate, the question of whether we should spend more resources to save them, or still focus on our own species first has once again become a hotly debated topic. In this essay, the views of both sides will be discussed in more detail, and I will conclude with my personal opinion.

The first group of people argue that out of all important global issues, human well-being should still be prioritized. This school of thought is not hard to understand, as every specie must think of their own survival first before others. This is probably more relatable now that ever, during times of recession where housing prices keep rising while GDPs are dropping around the world. At the end of the day, it is difficult to tell people who cannot afford to put food on the table to go out there and save the pandas.

On the other hand, animal activists hold the belief that animals should be treated equal as humans, and therefore, their problems should be considered as equally if not more important than those of our own. They argue that our obsession with conquering nature and improving the economy is the very reason many wild species are now endangered or worse, already extinct.

While I understand the sentiment of the first group, I stand with the latter. As can be seen in many man-made problems such as deforestation and poaching, it seems clear that humans have continually trampled on wild animals' rights and failed to respect their territories. With that being said, I also hope for a future of more sustainable development, where humans no longer destroys the wilderness while still improving their quality of life.

In summary, while humans no doubt have their own problems that should rightly be focused on, animal lives have been directly worsened because of us. Because of this, I hold the view that we should make a greater effort to protect wildlife, especially endangered species. !-->

<!-- Some people think art such as sculpture and music cannot improve the quality of people’s lives so the government should not spend money on them but on health and defence. What is your opinion?

Throughout human history, the arts have always played an important role and they still do nowadays. Unfortunately, their importance is not always well understood, which leads to some people believing that they do not have any concrete benefits. In this essay, the positive effects of the arts on a personal level, as well as on a national level will be discussed.

First of all, the belief that the arts do not have any direct utility in our everyday life is not necessarily true. While for most people, playing music or painting does not earn them money, it greatly enriches their quality of life. Indeed, many studies have shown that participating in, or simply enjoying arts and music can improve our mental health and holistic well being. These activities can also serve as an excellent medium of connecting people whether in schools, at the workplace or anywhere else in a society.

Furthermore, the artistic richness of a country is often directly linked with their success in the tourism industry. This can be easily seen in touristic hot spots such as Rome, Kyoto, Athens. It is in fact the architecture, the paintings, the unique culture of these places that draw people around the world.  Of course, this contradicts the viewpoint that the arts are merely superficial and do not have any economic benefits; in contrast, they significantly strengthen a country's economy and thus deserve more funding than many believe.

In summary, artistic endeavors not only improve our personal pursuit of happiness, but also have the potential of bringing in more business to any nation. Therefore, it is without a doubt a wise choice to allocate more national funding to these professions. !-->

Health is very important for everyone and healthcare should not be provided by private profit making companies. What is your opinion?

The question of whether or not the government should encourage private companies to provide medical services has always been a hotly debated topic. Contrary to what some may think, private healthcare can help everyone by easing the pressure placed on the public health system, as well as providing optional premium services to those who can afford it. In this essay, the benefits of private healthcare will be discussed.

First and foremost, there is a misconception that private healthcare only benefits the rich; in fact, it also helps those with lower income by indirectly reducing the number of patients in government-run facilities. In a world where these private companies did not exist, each hospital's waiting list would at least double or triple the size, making it much more difficult to rapidly seek the help you need. In reality, those who can pay for private healthcare will alleviate this burden on public services.

Furthermore, people who have the means to pay for premium services should be allowed to do so in a legitimate way. In fact, this is not so much a choice to make as it is an inevitable phenomenon. In a country that does not support private healthcare companies, these people will undoubtedly seek the services they want in a foreign country that does offer them. Therefore, it would be wiser for a government to support this type of business so that the money does not flow out to other countries, but instead come back in the end in the form of taxes.

In summary, while the concern that private health companies are not essential to the public is understandable, it is not necessarily well-founded. This type of business may help public health departments by redirecting the influx of patients, while legally providing better services to a certain demographic.

There are many problems caused by mobile phones. What are the advantages of mobile phones? What are the disadvantages?

It has almost become a tradition for modern high-tech devices to cause a lot of controversies around their pros and cons; the mobile phone has certainly lived up to this tradition left by its predecessors. While some are convinced that this invention has made both our professional and personal lives significantly easier, others argue that it has only impaired human attention span and degrade our social lives. In this essay, both sides of this argument will be discussed.

You certainly do not have to be a strong believer in cell phones to recognize their utility in the daily life. Whether you want to contact someone on the other side of the world, or to look up the most authentic Sicilian cannoli recipe, you can do it in five seconds thanks to the little device that fits in your pocket. Modern smartphones have proven to be especially useful during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the social distancing policies during this time, we could still keep in touch with colleagues and loved ones somewhat normally, which would have been totally impossible without smartphones.

However, the number of people who are wary of, or outright against these little devices is growing rapidly. They point out that the instant gratification provided by mobile applications are drastically reducing people's attention span. This is particularly true in young children who grow up with them since day one. Furthermore, this vapid happiness may also cause a type of virtual addiction that brings down our interests in interacting with people in the real world. Indeed, this can be easily observed in almost any restaurant nowadays, where the people would stare at their phone while waiting for their food instead of talking to their companions.

In summary, although it is difficult to argue against the usefulness of mobile phones, it is also necessary to recognize their drawbacks. A moderate use of these devices is essential to ensure that our daily lives goes smoothly, while at the same time not letting ourselves to be consumed by them.

Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Some people suggest that the circumstances of a crime, and the reasons for committing it should be taken into consideration when deciding on the punishment. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Whether or not the circumstance around a crime determine the severity of the punishment has always been a controversial topic. While there are many supporters of mandatory sentencing, there are also numerous activists who urge for a more nuanced approach. In this essay, both points of view, as well as the reason I prefer the latter will be discussed.

On one hand, advocates of fixed penalties argue that this approach is conducive to a more simple, fairer legal system that is less likely to be corrupted. Indeed, in a world where this approach is the norm, there would be almost no need for lawyers, since every court case can be concluded with a simple lookup of the corresponding sentence. Furthermore, with less complexity and flexibility in judging a crime comes less bribery. From this point of view, it does seem like mandatory sentencing is a rather compelling method.

On the other hand, proponents of taking the context of a crime into consideration believe that the above approach is badly flawed. To them, there is a clear difference between attacking someone out of pure aggression, versus for self-defense. While the person acting out of self-preservation should be left with little to no punishment, the one who harasses others is in fact a criminal and should be punished as such. 

Personally, I share the view of a nuanced look on each and every crime committed. The world we live in is complex, and it is impossible to boil down each offense to a single sentence. Such a system would only lead to unfairness and ultimately, injustice.

In summary, while mandatory sentencing has its merits, it is an unrealistic approach that should not be implemented in the world we live in. The circumstance of each crime determines its nature and therefore should be taken into consideration in court.
