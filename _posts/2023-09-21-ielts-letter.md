<!-- You had a very good experience in a local restaurant with your family. Write a letter to a newspaper to tell them about it, describe what you liked about it, and why you think the restaurant is worth visiting.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you about the excellent service that I recently received at the Pizza Italiana restaurant.

As you may know, this is a new restaurant that opened last month and as far as I know, it is the only Italians-owned in our town. I am happy to let you know that the quality of the food is excellent. Having been to Italy several times before, I knew what authentic Italian cuisine is supposed to taste like ; it is certainly not an easy standard to adhere to. Pizza Italiana did not disappoint in this regard, serving only the most freshly-baked pizzas and homemade pasta. Additionally, the ambiance when I was there was pleasant with classical Italian music, making it an ideal spot for romantic evenings.

I would appreciate it if you could publish my review of the restaurant so that more people know and have a chance to try Italian cuisine right in the heart of Hanoi.

Kind regards !-->

A friend wants to spend a four-week holiday in your country and has written asking for advice about the trip. Write a letter to your friend. In your letter: offer to find somewhere to stay, give advice about what to do, give information about what clothes to bring.

Dear Mark,

I was absolutely delighted to hear that you are able to finally come and visit Vietnam this Christmas. Since this will be your first time here, I'd like to offer you some pieces of advice to best prepare for it.

First of all, I advise you to look for accommodations near the West Lake area. They are near the downtown area, where most of the activities are, yet distant enough from the city center for you to not be bothered by the constant traffic noise. Next, as you may know, winter in Hanoi can get quite cold and windy. Thus, I suggest bringing warm clothes and a pair of ear warmers since you will likely be walking or commuting by motorbike a lot.

If you are interested in exploring authentic Vietnamese cuisine, please find a list of my favorite places attached; I can't wait to take you to some of them! There's also a famous beach an hour away from Hanoi that I can take you to on the weekend. Would that be something that you'll be interested in?

I look forward to seeing you!

Your friend,
