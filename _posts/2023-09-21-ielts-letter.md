<!-- You had a very good experience in a local restaurant with your family. Write a letter to a newspaper to tell them about it, describe what you liked about it, and why you think the restaurant is worth visiting.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you about the excellent service that I recently received at the Pizza Italiana restaurant.

As you may know, this is a new restaurant that opened last month and as far as I know, it is the only Italians-owned in our town. I am happy to let you know that the quality of the food is excellent. Having been to Italy several times before, I knew what authentic Italian cuisine is supposed to taste like ; it is certainly not an easy standard to adhere to. Pizza Italiana did not disappoint in this regard, serving only the most freshly-baked pizzas and homemade pasta. Additionally, the ambiance when I was there was pleasant with classical Italian music, making it an ideal spot for romantic evenings.

I would appreciate it if you could publish my review of the restaurant so that more people know and have a chance to try Italian cuisine right in the heart of Hanoi.

Kind regards !-->

<!-- A friend wants to spend a four-week holiday in your country and has written asking for advice about the trip. Write a letter to your friend. In your letter: offer to find somewhere to stay, give advice about what to do, give information about what clothes to bring.

Dear Mark,

I was absolutely delighted to hear that you are able to finally come and visit Vietnam this Christmas. Since this will be your first time here, I'd like to offer you some pieces of advice to best prepare for it.

First of all, I advise you to look for accommodations near the West Lake area. They are near the downtown area, where most of the activities are, yet distant enough from the city center for you to not be bothered by the constant traffic noise. Next, as you may know, winter in Hanoi can get quite cold and windy. Thus, I suggest bringing warm clothes and a pair of ear warmers since you will likely be walking or commuting by motorbike a lot.

If you are interested in exploring authentic Vietnamese cuisine, please find a list of my favorite places attached; I can't wait to take you to some of them! There's also a famous beach an hour away from Hanoi that I can take you to on the weekend. Would that be something that you'll be interested in?

I look forward to seeing you!

<!-- You will move to a new city because of your work. Ask some friends who live there for help finding accommodation. Tell them where you would like to live. Tell them the type of accommodation you are looking for.

Dear Alice,

I'm really excited to let you know that I'll be relocating to New York at the end of November for work. Knowing that you've already been there for more than five years, I thought I'd ask you for some pieces of advice on finding a suitable place to live!

First off, I live by myself, so realistically I don't need anything more than a single bedroom and ideally a proper kitchen. My budget is around $2,000, which I'm aware is not a lot for New York; because of this, I'm more than willing to live in a shared space. My two main priorities are a safe neighborhood and close proximity to a subway station. Anything better than this is an added bonus for me as you know I live quite simply and frugally.

Based on the information that I gave, which area of the city would you suggest I look into? Additionally, are there any websites or online groups that I should join for further information? Can't wait to hear your from you!

Your friend, !-->

<!-- You hired a car from a rental company and while you were driving on holiday, you have a small accident. You will have to write a report to the company to explain it. You need to explain the following:
1. Where you hired it and when? 2. Describe how the accident happened? 3. What you did after the accident?

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you about a minor accident that has occured to the vehicle I rented from your company.

The accident happened at around 5pm, yesterday afternoon, August the 20th. At the intersection between Main Street and Market Street, I was slowly decelerating to stop for the red light when all of a sudden the delivery person behind me decided to run the light. As he went through the tiny gap between my car and the sidewalk, his bike made contact and left a scratch on the vehicle.

The damage is minor but I thought it was something I should let you know. The person who caused the damage unfortunately did not stop to check on it, but I managed to get his plate number on the dash cam. Please let me know if you need the footage or anything else from me. I am sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Kind regards, !-->

<!-- You asked the bank for a new chequebook two weeks ago but you haven’t received anything. Write a letter to the manager complaining about the service. Say how and when you ordered the chequebook. Tell them when you need the chequebook by and ask the manager to send it to you before this date.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in regard to the chequebook request I have made two weeks ago. As of today, I still have not received it and I would like to ask for an update and an explanation for this delay.

I have submitted all of the necessary forms on August 20th via your web portal, which said that the chequebook would be delivered in seven business days. At the beginning of last week (eight business days after my first request), I have called your customer service and received the answer that there was a server error and that I would receive it within the next five days. However, today after two weeks, I still have not had it delivered to me.

I am requesting that the chequebook delivered to me as soon as possible as I need it for a very important housing payment. The deadline of the payment is approaching and I cannot afford to wait any longer.

With thanks, !-->

<!-- Write a letter to complain about a dangerous situation when some adolescents let their dogs run wild in public.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to the director board of Hyde Park in regard to an incident involving an irresponsible group of dog owners at your park that happened this morning, August 20th.

At around 9 AM, I was leisurely strolling in the park as usual when I heard some loud, chaotic dog barking. Soon I realized there were three unleashed bull dogs chasing each other around the flower garden area. Given that this is an aggressive dog breed, many people in the park were disturbed by their uncontrolled presence. It took me another moment to locate the dog owners, who were a group of teenagers. After a few people and I tried to convince them to leash the dogs, they finally complied.

As a frequent visiter of your park, I hope that you will consider putting more warnings in the park that no unleased big dogs should be allowed. These types of dogs can be very dangerous to everyone, especially those who cannot defend themselves such as young kids or the elderly.

Kind regards, !-->

You have a friend who is about to go to a university, and he wants you to suggest to him on which course to take – philosophy, in which he is very interested, or computer science, which offers better job prospects

Hi Mark!

I am so happy to hear from you again and to know that you are about to start your first year of university! It's been while since I was last in school, but I do have some pieces of advice regarding the two courses you are thinking about.

First off, please remember that the first year is a chance for you to explore your interests, so don't feel too pressured to settle on the right path this early on. Now, having taken both of those courses, I can assure that you can't go wrong with either of them. In fact, I would suggest taking both if your schedule allows it. "Introduction to computer science" when I took it was a very fun class with medium workload, and a final project where I got to build my own web page. On the other hand, "Introduction to philosophy" with Dr. Burns was truly a challenging class that challenged my world view and introduced me to many great philosophers and their outlook on life. Please note that it is a very reading-intensive course, but you probably already know this given that you've always been interested in the subject.

Lastly, I just want to close off by saying that while you should feel free to explore and take as many interesting courses as you want, I strongly suggest thinking about doing a major in computer science. As you may know, it offers by far the best job prospects at the moment, and I honestly think the trend will continue in the future.

Anyways, that was just my two cents. I'm confident that you'll be able to choose wisely and have a great time there. Congratulations once again for getting into university, and if you have any other questions, please let me know!

Your friend,
