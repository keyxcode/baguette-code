//==========================================
You had a very good experience in a local restaurant with your family. Write a letter to a newspaper to tell them about it, describe what you liked about it, and why you think the restaurant is worth visiting.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you about the excellent service that I recently received at the Pizza Italiana restaurant.

As you may know, this is a new restaurant that opened last month and as far as I know, it is the only Italians-owned in our town. I am happy to let you know that the quality of the food is excellent. Having been to Italy several times before, I knew what authentic Italian cuisine is supposed to taste like ; it is certainly not an easy standard to adhere to. Pizza Italiana did not disappoint in this regard, serving only the most freshly-baked pizzas and homemade pasta. Additionally, the ambiance when I was there was pleasant with classical Italian music, making it an ideal spot for romantic evenings.

I would appreciate it if you could publish my review of the restaurant so that more people know and have a chance to try Italian cuisine right in the heart of Hanoi.

Kind regards
