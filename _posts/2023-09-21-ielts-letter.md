//==========================================
You had a very good experience in a local restaurant with your family. Write a letter to a newspaper to tell them about it, describe what you liked about it, and why you think the restaurant is worth visiting.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you about the excellent service that I have received the Pizza Italiana restaurant recently.

As you might already be aware, this is a new restaurant that opened last month, and is as far as I know the only Italians-owned in our town. I am delighted to let you everything the restaurant had to offer lived up to my expectations. First and foremost, the food was exquisite. Having been to Italy several times before, I knew what authentic Italian cuisine was supposed to taste like, and it is certainly not a standard that is easy to adhere to. Pizza Italiana did not dissapoint in this regards, serving only the most freshly-baked pizza and homemade style pasta. Furthermore, the ambiance when I was there was very pleasant with classical Italian music being played, which makes it an ideal spot for romantic date nights.

I would appreciate it if you could publish my review of the restaurant so that more people will know about it, and have a chance to try Italian cuisine right in the heart of Hanoi.

Kind regards
